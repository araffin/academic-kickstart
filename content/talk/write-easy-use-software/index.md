title: "Designing (Robot) Software That Is Easy to Use"
event: Open-Source Hardware in the Era of Robot Learning at CoRL 2025
event_url: "https://open-hardware-robots.github.io/CoRL2025/"
location: Seoul, South Korea
summary: Hardware without software is like an instrument without a musician. Based on my experience maintaining the Stable-Baselines3 library and working with real robots, I will present key principles for creating easy-to-use interfaces.
