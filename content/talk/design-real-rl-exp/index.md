title: "Designing and Running Real-World RL Experiments"
event: RL4AA'24 Salzburg
event_url: https://rl4aa.github.io/RL4AA24/
location: Salzburg
summary: "Talk at the Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Accelerators workshop (RL4AA). The idea is to walk through the different steps of RL experimentation (task design, choosing the right algorithm, implementing safety layers) and also provide practical advice on how to run experiments and troubleshoot common problems."
