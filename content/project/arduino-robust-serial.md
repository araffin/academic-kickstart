**Robust Arduino Serial** is a simple and robust serial communication protocol. It was designed to make two Arduinos communicate, but can also be useful when you want a computer (e.g. a Raspberry Pi) to communicate with an Arduino.

**Please read the [Medium Article](https://medium.com/@araffin/simple-and-robust-computer-arduino-serial-communication-f91b95596788) to have an overview of this protocol.**

Implementations are available in various programming languages:

- Arduino (`arduino-serial/` folder)
- [Python](https://github.com/araffin/python-arduino-serial)
- [C++](https://github.com/araffin/cpp-arduino-serial)
- [Rust](https://github.com/araffin/rust-arduino-serial)
