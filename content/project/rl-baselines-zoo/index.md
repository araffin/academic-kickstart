A collection of trained Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents, with tuned hyperparameters, using [Stable Baselines](https://github.com/hill-a/stable-baselines).

Github repository: https://github.com/araffin/rl-baselines-zoo

Goals of this repository:

1. Provide a simple interface to train and enjoy RL agents
2. Benchmark the different Reinforcement Learning algorithms
3. Provide tuned hyperparameters for each environment and RL algorithm
4. Have fun with the trained agents!
